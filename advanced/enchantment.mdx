## How much XP do Fodders give?
- You get 200xp per fodder. However, if cards with same name are consumed you get 600xp per fodder.
<Note>Cards with same name refers to the same character name. Ex: **Ultimate Rina Tennoji** consumes **Platinum Rina Tennoji** cards 
to gain 3x Exp.</Note>

## How many Cards are Required for Max Level?
- The number of cards needed to enchant a card varies based on your current card level.
- Use `iz cards <current level> <max level>` to see the number of cards required to reach your desired level.
