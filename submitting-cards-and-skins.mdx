## Quality Assurance
<Note>We know it is difficult to always find good art. And some of your favorite series may not have good art. 
**DO NOT STRESS OVER IT**. We are also generous and sometimes make exceptions, 
do not shy away from suggesting new cards.</Note>
### Acceted Art
- HD Art with higher resolution of atleast 720p.
- Free to use Art or Fan made Art are accepted.
- Sometimes AI generated Art are accepted if the quality is good.
