teams take priority during battle.</Note><img class="rounded-md" src="../images/tm-equip.jpg" />

## How to Unequip Item
- There is no direct way to unequip an item from a Team. You will just have to reset the team which clears both
assigned cards and items. 

### Usage
- command: `iz tm reset <team name>` <img class="rounded-md" src="../images/tm-reset.jpg" />
